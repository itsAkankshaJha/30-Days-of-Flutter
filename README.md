<h1>E-Commerce App using Flutter</h1>

<h2> My first Flutter Application.</h2>
<p>
My first flutter project is a mobile application for e commerce. My app has mainly three pages
 the first is login page
 the second is the main page of the app where you can see the list of items in a vertical manner
 the third is a description of each item which includes buy button and a add to cart button
 And finally a cart page where you can save your favourite items
 This app also works in dark mode.</p>
